# UTS-2 My Songs for You

[Verse 1]
I’ve been running through the same old streets,
Dreams fading under neon lights.
Everybody’s chasing what they need,
I’m just chasing something right.

Coffee’s cold, my mind’s still loud,
All these plans, but none feel proud.
I tried to be the one they see,
But I’m still figuring out me.

[Chorus]
And I don’t know where I’m going,
But I’ll sing beneath my sky.
I’ll keep rolling, never knowing,
One more day, one more try.
Yeah, I’ll stand beneath my sky.

[Verse 2]
People talk, they never stay,
Words like smoke, they fade away.
I’ve been quiet, but I’ve been strong,
Just tryna write where I belong.

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe it’s not about the fame,
Maybe it’s just about the flame,
That keeps me walking through the rain —
Still burning, still the same.

[Chorus]
And I don’t know where I’m going,
But I’ll sing beneath my sky.
I’ll keep rolling, never knowing,
One more day, one more try.
Yeah, I’ll stand beneath my sky.

[Bridge]
Oh, they said the world’s too wide,
But I’ve got music on my side.
And when my time runs dry,
I’ll still hum that lullaby.

[Final Chorus]
And I don’t care if they find me,
I’ve got peace in what I try.
No more chains to define me,
I’m alive beneath my sky —
Yeah, I’m alive beneath my sky.
